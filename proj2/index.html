<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    We created a tool that can perform different operations on mesh models. It can also calculate Bezier curves and surfaces.
</p>
<br>


<h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>
    We used de Casteljau’s algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves. De Casteljau’s algorithm is where you linearly interpolate between the control points on a parameter t. You can keep doing this recursively and the lowest recursion level will be a single point that lies on the Bezier curve. If you keep feeding in different values of t (between 0 and 1), it will trace out the Bezier curve. We were able to implement this algorithm by iterating through a list of points and linearly interpolating adjacent points in the list. We then save the results in a list that we can use to run the algorithm again.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>
    With surfaces, you can treat it as a list of list points that define a Bezier curve. To make de Casteljau’s algorithm work with surfaces, you will need two parameter values u and v. You will use u to run the algorithm on each list. This will result in a list of points which can be used to run the algorithm again with v to get a point that lies on the Bezier surface. To do this in code, we iterated through a 2d array. We ran de Casteljau’s algorithm on each row with parameter u and combined the results in a single list. We then ran the algorithm again with v to return a point on the Bezier surface.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<p>
    To implement area weighted vertices, we use the loop traversal method shown in discussion. This was done by first getting the starting vertex. SInce each vertex points to a halfedge, we use the halfedge variable in Vertex to get the starting point. To get the next vertex, we get the vertex of the twin’s next() halfedge and repeat until we return to our starting vertex. During iteration, we keep track of variables curr and prev that point to the current vertex and the previous loop’s vertex. With the starting vertex, these are used to calculate the area of each triangle using the formula A = 0.5(a x b + b x c + c x a) where a, b, and c are the vectors between each vertex. Then, we find its norm and proceed with the process described in the spec. We have a variable retVal that tracks the sum of the weights, and at the end, we normalize and return it. In the images below, the top image is without weighted shading, and the bottom is with weighted shading. As shown, the bottom image has gradual shading on each of the planes of the object, giving it a smoother look.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<p>
    Since there are many objects to keep track of, we started by creating a variable pointing to every halfedge, vertex, edge, and face associated with the two triangles. Then, we reassigned the variables according to the first image below. For example, for h1, we would have h1->setNeighbors(h2, h7, v2, e2, f0). We did this for every object involved even for assignments that do not change, ensuring that no object is forgotten. The second and third images show before and after edge flip.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<p>
	Similar to task 4, we first created variables assigned to every object associated with the two mesh triangles. Then, we create a new vertex, three new edges, and 2 new faces. Then, we assign our current and new elements as shown in the image below on the right (blue highlights are the new objects). 

</p>
<p>
	Before returning the new vertex, we calculated the new position of the vertex. We needed to ensure that it was inside the triangles, so we took the average of the four surrounding vertices to get a midpoint for the new vertex.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

<p>
    We used the steps as outlined in the spec: for step one, we calculated all the updated positions of the original vertices by iterating through each of its original neighbors for the neighbor’s sum. After calculating the new position, we stored it in the variable newPosition. Afterwards, we looped through all the original edges and traversed its vertices to calculate the positions of the new vertices, which were then stored in each edge’s newPosition variable. In addition, each vertex and edge had their isNew variable set to false to indicate that they were part of the original mesh (since new ones are created with split). Next we iterated through all the edges and split them if they were an original edge. This will create two new edges and half of the original edge. To prevent half of an original edge from splitting again, we also checked if both of its vertices were also original. Splitting an edge will return the newly created vertex, so we set that vertex’s newPosition to the edge’s newPosition. Then, we flip all the new edges. We checked the isNew flag to make sure the split original edges do not get flipped. Then, we iterated through all of the vertices and edges to update their positions and reset their isNew flags for the next upsampling.
</p>
<p>
    
Observations: During upsampling, edges and corners round out since the faces they are connected to become further split, which creates new faces that can fold. By upsampling more, we eventually get a smooth curve at each corner and edge. Under Rounding Corners and Edges in the images below, we tried splitting edges on faces connected to the corner first before upsampling, but it still leads to smoother corners. Asymmetry occurs during upsampling because all the face edges are in a diagonal from top left to bottom right, so when the edges are split, we get asymmetrical edges. This can be solved by splitting these face edges, and the bottom 2 images (under Fixing Asymmetry) give symmetrical upsampling using this method.
