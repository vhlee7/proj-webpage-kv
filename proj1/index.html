<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  We created a rasterizer that can draw images with different resolutions with
  supersampling, do hierarchical transforms, and texture mapping with
  antialiasing. We thought it was interesting that we can calculate what the
  color for a pixel should be based on its surrounding colors. We also thought
  it was interesting that rendering pictures requires so much memory since we
  need to store a larger version of the picture as a buffer.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>
  We rasterized the triangles by iterating through all the points in a bounding
  box that just encapsulates the triangle. We offset the point by 0.5 in both
  x and y to sample the middle of the point and check if that point was within
  the bounds of the triangle using the point-in-triangle test. Because we could
  not assume anything about the ordering of the triangle vertices, we also
  checked if all the points were outside all of the lines, and it must be
  inside of the triangle if the vertices were passed in in another order. If
  it passed this test, we set it inside of the sample buffer. We found the
  bounding box by finding the max and min x and y values that the triangle
  touches. We use these four points as our bounding box of the triangle.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p>
  For supersampling, we followed a similar algorithm to sampling, but for each
  point, we sampled the square root of sample rate pixels instead of one. To do
  this, we traversed the pixel array with a nested for loop, and within it, we
  had another nested for loop to traverse the sampling points based on the
  sampling rate. This splitted up each pixel into a grid of squares where we
  sampled at the center of each square. The color assigned was then based on
  the triangle line test as in task 1. We then modified the
  resolve_to_framebuffer method to traverse the pixel array, and for each
  pixel, we would have a nested for loop that averaged the values at the sample
  points to give the final value for that pixel. Supersampling is useful for
  making our edges and corners look smooth, which reduces the jaggies effect.
  In the rasterization process, the main modification made was the extra nested
  for loop to go through the sample points based on the sampling rate. Below
  shows the effect of supersampling at 1, 4, and 16 (from top image to bottom),
  and it shows how the corner of the triangle smooths by “blurring” pixels that
  are near or on the line. At a rate of 1, there are gaps in the triangle
  because pixels that are partially within the bounds of the triangle are not
  counted as part of the triangle. However, when we increase the sample rate,
  these pixels are given an averaged value between being within the triangle
  and outside of it. This gives a smoother transition along the boundaries and
  thus smooths out the triangle’s edges.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>
  Barycentric coordinates allow us to sample a point within the triangle
  based on its position from as well as the values of the vertices. By using
  the formulas for alpha, beta, and gamma, we obtain the weights corresponding
  to that point, allowing us to calculate any average value for that point
  ( ex. color, texture). For example, if we wanted to make a gradient in a
  triangle with the colors red, green, and blue each at the vertices VA, VB,
  and VC, we would use barycentric coordinates to compute the required color
  value at each point within the triangle.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
  Pixel sampling is trying to map a color in a texture onto a screen. We have
  a texture in the coordinates (u,v) that we want to map onto a screen (x,y).
  We can convert these coordinates using the barycentric coordinates method.
Sampling using nearest will round the uv coordinates to the nearest color in
the MIP Map. To implement this, we scaled and rounded the uv coordinates to the
nearest pixel in the mipmap. Sampling using bilinear will linearly interpolate
the four colors surrounding the uv point to get a more accurate color. We found
the four surrounding colors by flooring and ceiling the scaled uv coordinates.
We then found the vertical and horizontal distances of the uv point from the
bottom left corner and used that to linearly interpolate the colors. We
interpolated horizontally on the colors above and below the point, and combined
those results by interpolating them vertically.

Since nearest just rounds to the nearest color, it can lead to more aliasing.

Below is a comparison between sample rate 1 with nearest, sample rate 1 with
bilinear, sample rate 16 with nearest, and sample rate 16 with bilinear. For
the sample rate 1 comparison, the back heel of the Italian boot is more clearly
defined when using bilinear interpolation, and for the sample rate 16
comparison, bilinear interpolation gives the island to the left a smoother
border. The differences between the two will get greater if there is a drastic
change in color over a smaller space, like the difference between the land and
sea.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
  Level sampling is when we match the resolution of a texture with our sampling
  rate. To do this, we used a mipmap, which contained different resolutions of
  a texture and assigned those resolutions a level. We first obtained the uv
  coordinates of a point within a triangle by finding its barycentric
  coordinates and computing the weighted average based on the uv coordinates of
  the vertices. This allowed us to calculate the level of the mipmap that
  corresponded to the uv coordinate by using the formula given in lecture .
  The level that was returned was based on the lsm variable. If it was level
  zero, we returned 0. If it was L_nearest, we rounded the level using the
  round method. Finally, for L-linear, we returned the level as a float, and
  in our sample method, to compute the color, we took the floor and ceiling of
  the level and calculated the weighted average of the two levels (ex. If the
  level was 0.3, we would have the
  color value 0.7 x (level 0) + 0.3 x (level 1)).

Increasing the sampling rate seems to be very effective, but it requires a
substantial amount of memory and is slow at higher sampling rates. Using level
sampling allowed for a faster process since we could sample lower resolution
textures. However, the image was not as clear, and it uses a large amount of
rendering since it needs to store different resolutions of a texture. Bilinear
and nearest seem to be the most effective for antialiasing, and it is quite
fast. For bilinear pixel sampling, we were able to interpolate colors around
four points, so it was similar to sampling at a rate of 4, but requiring less
memory as it did not need to increase its sample buffer size.
