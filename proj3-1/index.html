<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    We created a render that can render realisitic images using path tracing.

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
Show images with normal shading for a few small .dae files. -->
<h3>
  Ray Generation
</h3>
<p>
	The first task was to set up the camera. Since the camera depends on the field of view, we mapped the position of the camera to the camera sensor based on the dimensions of the sensor. The formula used was <pre>cameraX = minX + ((maxX - minX)*x) </pre> and <pre>cameraY = minY + ((maxY - minY)*y)</pre> where max/minX and max/minY are the dimensions of the sensor and x, y are the coordinates of the camera in the image space. Then the camera space was generated and converted to world space using c2w. The next task was to be able to generate rays. We approached this part similarly to how we did supersampling. We traversed the grid of pixels, and we took a specified number of samples, each of which generated a ray using generate_ray from the previous task. The samples were then averaged, giving us the value of the pixel. The final part was writing the intersection methods for triangles and spheres. These let us test whether or not a ray intersects an object. For triangles, we used barycentric coordinates to test if the intersection is within the triangle, and for spheres, we used quadratic equations and solved for the roots. Aftering finding the intersection t, we fill in and update an Intersection object if t lies within the ray’s min_t and max_t.
</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Scene Intersection
</h3>
<p>
    The triangle intersection algorithm we used was the Möller Trumbore algorithm, as shown in the image below. We let P0, P1, and P2 correspond to the given vertex parameters p1, p2, and p3 respectively, and O was set to the origin of the ray. Solving for S, S1, S2, E1, and E2 allowed us to solve for t, b1, and b2. Then, b1, b2, and 1- b1 - b2 give us the barycentric coordinates, and if they are all greater than or equal to 0, then the intersection is inside the triangle.

<!-- Walk through your BVH construction algorithm. Explain the heuristic you chose for picking the splitting point.

<h3>
  BVH Construction Algorithm
</h3>
<p>
	To construct the bvh, we iterated through all of the primitives and calculated an average centroid between them. If the number of primitives was less than or equal to the max_leaf_size, then we would create a leaf node with all the primitives passed in and return. If not, we then came up with a huerisitc to split them into left and right nodes. Using the average centroid we calculated, and on each axis, we counted the number of primitives centroids that were less than the average on the respective axis. We then chose the axis that would split most evenly. With that we were able to create two close to even lists for the left and right nodes, one with centroid values less than average, and another one with centroid values greater than or equal to the average.

<h3>
  BVH acceleration comparison
</h3>
<p>
    To test our BVH algorithm, we compared the rendering times of moderately complex scenes with and without BVH accerlation. For cow.dae, with 5856 primitives, it took 3.6628s to render without BVH accerlation and 0.0339s to render with our BVH split huerisitc.  For teapot.dae, with 2464 primitives, it took 1.4207s to render without BVH accerlation and 0.0387s to render with our BVH split huerisitc.

<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Adaptive Sampling (20 Points)</h2>
<!-- Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.
Pick one scene and render it with at least 2048 samples per pixel. Show a good sampling rate image with clearly visible differences in sampling rate over various regions and pixels. Include both your sample rate image, which shows your how your adaptive sampling changes depending on which part of the image you are rendering, and your noise-free rendered result. Use 1 sample per light and at least 5 for max ray depth. -->

<h3>
  Adaptive Sampling Implementation
</h3>
<p>
    Adaptive sampling tells us when the amount of light in a pixel has converged. We can check if the light has converged to end sampling early. This allows us to increase the number of samples to reduce noise in certain parts of the image without doing extra calculations for parts of the image that converge quicker. For each iteration of the sample, we calculate the current illuminance and squared illuminance of the sample and as well as the number of times we have sampled so far. Every samplesPerBatch iterations we use the accumulated values to calculate the mean and standard deviation to check if the convergance requirement has been met. The requirement is I <= maxTolarance * mean. We calculate the value I = 1.96 * (standard_deviation / sqrt(n)), where n is the number of times we have sampled so far. If it is satisfied then we can stop sampling.
